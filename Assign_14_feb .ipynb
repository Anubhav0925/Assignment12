In many cases, the condition is caused by a lack of, or mistreatment, communication between different locking devices (for thread synchronization purposes). Deadlock is also defined by the conditions that the corresponding system must have at the same time for a deadlock. These issues were first raised by the media computer scientist Edward G. Coffman, Jr., and as a result became known as the Coffman conditions."
